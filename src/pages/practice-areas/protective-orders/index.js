            <h2>PROTECTIVE ORDERS</h2>
            <p className="text">
              In Texas, there are three types of orders of protection based on
              family violence: 1. Temporary ex parte protective order (only
              valid for a short period of time, but no notice is usually
              required to the other party); 2. Final (permanent) protective
              order (can be valid for years - but is only issued by the Court
              after notice and a hearing); and 3. Magistrateâ€™s order of
              emergency protection (what most people call an emergency
              protective order).
              <br />
              <br />
              The first two orders can be issued by the family Court, while the
              third is only issued by a criminal Court after an arrest. The
              attorneys at Dally & Webb, PLLC are highly skilled and trained to
              assess a situation to determine if the facts are sufficient to
              support the burden of proof the Court requires for the issuance of
              a Protective Order - and can guide you through the process of
              obtaining such protection if you are the victim of family
              violence.
